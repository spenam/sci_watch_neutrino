to do

- azimuth angle integration
- arbitrary photomultiplier firections
- compare codes
- include azimuth integrations
- look for ray tracing scattering online

my thoughts

- shouldnt there be a 4pi in the numerator of the equation from implicit solid
  angle integration?

** 2 December **

- Try doing the bining for the sections of the PMT sphere as in brunner's
  presentation.
- Check the PhD thesis brunner sent for montecarlo integration.
