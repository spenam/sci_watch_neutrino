to do

- azimuth angle integration
- arbitrary photomultiplier firections
- compare codes
- include azimuth integrations
- look for ray tracing scattering online

my thoughts

- shouldnt there be a 4pi in the numerator of the equation from implicit solid
  angle integration?

** 2 December **

- Try doing the bining for the sections of the PMT sphere as in brunner's
  presentation.
- Check the PhD thesis brunner sent for montecarlo integration.

** Meeting 13 January ** :

- write again the document using brunner's corrections sent by email
- reproduce some numbers on the slides
- opening angle is 30 degree and the omt changes the 


** Meeting 10 February ** :

- Read paper on ANTARES measurements of sea water properties and understand
  why their measurements are not very precise.
- Do a minimization process on the values calculated by the code that
  calculates the rates by adjusting the absorption length and the overall
factor.
- Check how Geant4 might be implemented in our case
- Work on the draft report from last semester.
- Send email to authors of the julia CloudScat.jl package.
